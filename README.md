# Full-Stack Python & AI Systems Development Training

This repository contains a comprehensive, self-paced training curriculum for mastering Full-Stack Python and AI Systems Development. The curriculum is designed to take approximately 4-5 months to complete and covers all aspects of modern software development, from backend fundamentals to AI agent workflows.

## Curriculum Overview

The training is structured into 12 modules covering a wide range of topics:

1. **Core Python & Async Foundations** - Modern typing, async programming, logging
2. **API Development with FastAPI** - RESTful services, middleware, auth
3. **Data Persistence â€“ SQL + Graph** - SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Neo4j
4. **Messaging with Kafka** - Event streaming, producers/consumers, error handling
5. **Redis & Caching Strategies** - Distributed caching, rate limiting
6. **Observability & Monitoring** - Metrics, tracing, logging
7. **Secrets & Secure Auth** - OAuth2, JWT, Vault, TLS
8. **Frontend with React** - React fundamentals, state management, UI/UX
9. **Deployment & DevOps** - Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes
10. **AI Agent Workflows** - Prompt engineering, tool-calling, retrieval
11. **Testing & Quality Gates** - Unit/integration testing, mocking, automation
12. **Final Capstone: OpenStackify** - Full-stack system integrating all technologies

## Repository Structure

- **/projects-desc/** - Comprehensive project descriptions for each module
- **/progress/** - Track your progress through the curriculum
- **/modules/** - (To be populated) Code and implementation for each module

## Getting Started

1. Review the complete curriculum in `/plan/overview.md`
2. Explore individual module details in `/plan/module-X.md` files
3. Check project specifications in `/projects-desc/` directory
4. Use `/progress/module-tracker.md` to track your journey

## Module Progression

Each module builds on the previous ones and includes:

- **Micro-projects** - Small, focused implementations of specific concepts
- **Branch projects** - Larger projects combining multiple concepts within a submodule
- **Capstone projects** - End-of-module projects integrating all concepts learned

## Final Capstone

The training culminates in building **OpenStackify** - a complete open-source full-stack system that integrates all the technologies covered throughout the curriculum. This includes:

- Multiple microservices with FastAPI
- Dual database approach (PostgreSQL + Neo4j)
- Kafka event streaming
- Redis caching
- React frontend
- AI-powered assistant
- Complete DevOps pipeline

## Learning Approach

This curriculum is designed for self-paced learning with a focus on practical, hands-on projects. Each module includes both study materials and project work to reinforce concepts through application.

Track your progress by marking completed items in the progress tracker and documenting key learnings in your own notes.
