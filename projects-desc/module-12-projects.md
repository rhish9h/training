# Module 12: Final Capstone â€“ OpenStackify - Project Description

## Final Capstone Project: OpenStackify

**Objective**: Design, build, and deploy a complete open-source full-stack system integrating all technologies learned throughout the training curriculum.

### Project Overview

OpenStackify is an open-source service designed to manage, query, and visualize tech stack capabilities for any team or project. It demonstrates the practical application of all the skills acquired in Modules 1-11, creating a real-world multi-service architecture with clear domain boundaries and production-ready patterns.

- Dual database approach with PostgreSQL for relational data and Neo4j for relationship visualization
- Kafka event streaming between services (e.g., feedback and scoring engines)
- Redis for caching API responses and managing rate limits
- React frontend with dashboards, filters, and dark mode support
- Complete testing suite with CI/CD pipeline integration
- Docker containerization with optional Kubernetes deployment
- AI Agent for generating tool stack recommendations
