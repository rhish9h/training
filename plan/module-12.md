# ðŸ“˜ Module 12: Final Capstone â€“ OpenStackify

**Estimated Duration:** 40h (1â€“2 week sprint)

### ðŸ§© Description

Design, build, and deploy a **complete open-source full-stack system** integrating all learned technologies from Modules 1â€“11. The application simulates a real-world multi-service architecture with clear domain boundaries and production-ready patterns.

### ðŸ§± System Overview

**App Name:** OpenStackify â€“ an open-source service to manage, query, and visualize tech stack capabilities for any team/project.

### ðŸ’¡ Features

* Full CRUD REST APIs using FastAPI with auth, background jobs, and observability
* Postgres for relational data; Neo4j for visualizing relationships between tools, teams, or libraries
* Kafka event streaming between services (e.g., feedback + scoring engines)
* Redis for caching API responses and managing rate limits
* React frontend with dashboards, filters, and dark mode
* Fully tested with CI/CD pipeline, Docker, GitHub Actions, optional Kubernetes
* AI Agent assists users in generating tool stack recommendations
